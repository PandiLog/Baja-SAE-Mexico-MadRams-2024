# Baja SAE México – MadRams 2024

Baja SAE is an international student competition organized by SAE International, where teams design, build, and race a single-seat off-road vehicle. The challenge focuses on engineering design, manufacturing, endurance, and cost-efficiency under real-world constraints.

This repository documents my technical involvement in the **Baja SAE México 2024** competition as a member of the **MadRams** team from Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Guadalajara.



## Role and Contributions

During the design and preparation of the off-road vehicle, I contributed mainly to the **manufacturing and assembly areas**, including:

- **Fabrication of critical components**:
  - I manufactured spare suspension forks arms.
  - Manufactured suspension bushings using a bench lathe.
- **CNC machine setup assistance**:
  - Centering and workpiece fixing
  - Tool selection and changes
  - Supervising basic CNC operations
- **Key pre-competition assemblies**:
  - Rear axle installation
  - 4x4 chain installation
- **Driving**:
  - Piloted the car during the pulling test, contributing to our 1st place result.



## Competition Results

- 1st place in the **pulling test** (driving performance).
- **4th Place overall** – Baja SAE México 2024
- Successfully passed all technical inspections.
- Effective teamwork under high-pressure conditions
